# JSON generator for CUTIE


Here are two files based on script wrote by @hhien (https://github.com/hhien/tesseract_applications) which generate a json file from a receipt image.
These json files are like what CUTIE (https://github.com/vsymbol/CUTIE) take as input.

Run tesseractOCR.py if you want to generate json file without any image processing (else run tesseractOCR_processor.py).

I hope you will enjoy ^^ !
